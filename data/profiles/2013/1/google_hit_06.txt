The '''Quintinshill rail disaster''' occurred on 22 May 1915 near [[Gretna Green]], [[Dumfriesshire]], [[Scotland]] at Quintinshill, an intermediate [[signal box]] with [[passing loop]]s on each side on the [[Caledonian Main Line]] linking [[Glasgow]] and [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]] (now part of the [[West Coast Main Line]]).

The accident involved five trains, and killed a probable 226{{#tag:ref|This total comprises 214 soldiers on the troop train, 9 passengers from the two passenger trains and three railway employees. Four bodies were identified as those of children and speculated to be stowaways on the troop train, but the probability is that they were among the 50 troops whose bodies were never recovered at all.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Lt.-Col. Druitt's official report into the accident gives the figure as 227 (he did not mention the four children),{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=26}} but he compiled the report very soon after the accident and gave the number of troops killed as 215 which was later revised downwards by the army to 214, the figure which appears on the memorial in the Rosebank Cemetery in [[Edinburgh]].|group=nb |name=nb1}} and injured 246 and remains the worst [[rail crash]] in the United Kingdom in terms of loss of life.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/8/newsid_3075000/3075197.stm |title= BBC On this day 8 October 1952 |year = 2008 |publisher=BBC | accessdate = 14 January 2012}}</ref> Those killed were mainly [[Territorial Force|Territorial soldier]]s from the 1/7th ([[Leith]]) Battalion, the [[Royal Scots]] heading for [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. The precise death toll was never established with confidence as the roll list of the regiment was destroyed by the fire.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=26}}

The first collision occurred when a southbound troop train travelling from {{stnlnk|Larbert}}, [[Stirlingshire]] to [[Liverpool]], [[Lancashire]]  collided with a local [[passenger train]] that had been shunted on to the main line.{{sfn|Rolt|Kichenside|1982|p=208}} Wreckage spilled over onto the northbound line, causing a second collision only a minute later, as a sleeper train from London to Glasgow ploughed into the wreckage of the first collision. Gas from the [[Pintsch gas]] lighting system of the old wooden carriages of the troop train ignited, starting a fire which soon engulfed the three passenger trains and also two [[goods train]]s standing on nearby passing loops. Some bodies were never recovered, having been wholly consumed by the fire, and the bodies that were recovered were buried together in a mass grave in Edinburgh's [[Rosebank Cemetery]]. Four bodies, believed to be of children, were never identified or claimed and are buried in the Western Necropolis, [[Glasgow]]. Pte William Clark of the 1/7th Battalion who died from injuries received aged 24 is buried in the Edinburgh Eastern Cemetery at Drum Terrace.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

An official inquiry, completed on 17 June 1915 for the Board of Trade, found the cause of the collision to be neglect of the rules by two signalmen. Both were charged with manslaughter in England, then convicted of [[culpable homicide]] after trial in Scotland; the two terms are broadly equivalent. After they were released from a Scottish jail in 1916, they were re-employed by the railway company, although not as signalmen.

A memorial to the dead soldiers was erected soon after the accident and there are more recent memorials at various locations. An annual remembrance service is held at Rosebank Cemetery.

==The place==

The [[Ordnance Survey]] 1:2500 map of 1859 (but not modern maps) shows a house named "Quintinshill" at approximately 55.0133°N 3.0591°W, about 778 meters south-southeast of the signal box, on a thin strip of land on the east side of a minor road in the middle of [https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@55.0128509,-3.0597908,1380m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en this Google Earth view from above].

== Sequence of events ==

The accident occurred owing to poor working practices on the part of the two [[Signalman (rail)|signalmen]] involved; George Meakin, who had worked the night [[shift work|shift]], and James Tinsley, who was to work the early day shift. If they had been working according to regulations, then Tinsley would have taken over from Meakin at 6.00 am. The two men, though, had developed an informal arrangement allowing whoever was working the early shift to arrive later. If the local passenger train from Carlisle to {{stnlnk|Beattock}} was due to be [[Shunt (railway operations)|shunted]] at Quintinshill{{#tag:ref|Normally the local train would not shunt at Quintinshill but a rule allowed for the train to be shunted at one of the intermediate stations or signalboxes if one or other of the night expresses from London to Glasgow were running late.{{sfn|Rolt|Kichenside|1982|p=207}}|group=nb}} then the signalman at Gretna would advise whoever was working the early shift of this and the day signalman would hitch a ride on the local train to Quintinshill, thus saving himself the {{convert|1.5|mi|1}} walk from Gretna. To avoid their malpractice being detected by company management, whoever was working the night shift would record all train movements after 6.00 am on a piece of paper rather than record them in the [[absolute block signalling#Train register|train register]]. When the day man arrived, he would copy the entries from the paper into the train register, making it appear that the shift change had occurred at the correct time.{{sfn|Nock|1980|p=109}}

On the morning of 22 May the night [[express train|expresses]] were both running late so the local train had to be shunted at Quintinshill, and therefore Tinsley took advantage of the free ride on the local train to arrive there at about 6.30 am.{{sfn|Rolt|Kichenside|1982|p=208}} As the [[passing loop|goods loop]] was occupied with the 4.50 am [[freight train|goods train]] from Carlisle, Meakin decided to shunt the local passenger train onto the [[Railroad directions#United Kingdom|Up main line]]<ref group=nb>On the line between Carlisle and Glasgow, Up is towards Carlisle and Down is towards Glasgow.</ref>  Although not a preferred method of operation, this was not a dangerous thing to do if the proper precautions were taken. Out of the previous 21 occasions that the local train had been shunted at Quintinshill, on four occasions it had been shunted onto the Up line.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=32}}  On this occasion neither of the important safety precautions were taken. Firstly, Kirkpatrick signal box (the preceding box in the Up direction) was not sent the "blocking back" signal which would have informed the Kirkpatrick signalman that the line was occupied and warned him not to send any more trains towards Quintinshill.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|pp=34–35}}  Secondly, the signalman at Quintinshill should have placed a signal lever collar over the relevant signal lever to stop himself from clearing the signal and allowing another train to proceed from Kirkpatrick.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=23}}

The laxity of the [[Fireman (steam engine)|fireman]] of the local train, George Hutchinson, in carrying out his duties under [[Rule 55]] meant that Tinsley's and Meakin's failures went unobserved.  Had Hutchinson carried out his duty correctly, he would have reminded the signalman that his train was standing on the Up main line and would have checked that a lever collar was in place before returning to his train. He did neither, and merely signed the train register, using a pen which Tinsley, who was intent on filling in the train register, handed over his shoulder without looking up, and left the signal box at 6.46 am.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|pp=35–36}}  Also in the signal box, against the rules, were two other railwaymen (brakesmen from the two goods trains) whose presence may have distracted Tinsley and Meakin, who were discussing the [[First World War|war]] with the two brakesmen.{{sfn|Nock|1980|p=112}}
[[File:Quintinshill animation 1.gif|frame|center|Animation of the series of events causing the crash.]]
At 6.34 am one of the signalmen (it was never established who) gave the "[[absolute block signalling#Signalling a train|train out of section]]" bell to Kirkpatrick for the coal train which now stood in the up goods loop.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=25}} After giving train out of section, this was the point at which the "blocking back" signal should have been given to Kirkpatrick but neither man did this.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=25}} At 6.38 am the first of the expresses from Carlisle passed Quintinshill heading north. At 6.42 am Kirkpatrick "[[absolute block signalling#Signalling a train|offered]]" the troop train to Tinsley.  Tinsley immediately accepted this and four minutes later was offered the second northbound express from Gretna Junction.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=23}}  At 6.47 am Tinsley received the "train entering section" signal from Kirkpatrick for the troop train and offered it forward to Gretna Junction, having forgotten all about the local passenger train which was occupying the Up line.  It was immediately accepted by Gretna Junction so Tinsley pulled "off" his Up home signal to allow the troop train forward.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=23}}  Had he placed a lever collar on this signal as he should have done (and as Hutchinson should have checked) then Tinsley would not have been able to pull the signal lever.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=25}}

The troop train collided head on with the stationary local train on the up line at 6.49 am.{{sfn|Rolt|Kichenside|1982|p=229}} Just over a minute later, the second of the express trains ran into the wreckage. The wreckage also included the [[goods train]] in the down loop and a train of empty coal trucks in the up loop.  At 6.53 Tinsley sent the "Obstruction Danger" bell signal to both Gretna and Kirkpatrick, stopping all traffic and alerting others to the disaster.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=51}}

==Fire==
[[File:Quintinshill rail disaster - Secours-voiture-de-queue.jpg|thumb|The burned out remains of a carriage at the disaster scene.]]
Many men on the troop train were killed as a result of the two collisions, but the disaster was made much worse by a subsequent fire. The great wartime traffic and a shortage of carriages meant that the railway company had to press into service obsolete [[Great Central Railway]] stock. These carriages had wooden bodies and frames, with very little crash resistance compared with steel-framed carriages, and were gas-lit using the [[Pintsch gas]] system.{{sfn|Rolt|Kichenside|1982|pp=209–210}} The gas was stored in reservoirs slung under the underframe and these ruptured in the collision. Escaping gas was ignited by the coal-burning fires of the engines. The gas reservoirs had been filled before leaving Larbert, and this, and the lack of available water, meant that the fire was not extinguished until the morning of the next day, despite the best efforts of railway staff and the Carlisle fire brigade.{{sfn|Rolt|Kichenside|1982|p=211}}

The troop train had consisted of 21 vehicles; all were consumed in the fire, apart from the rear six, which had broken away during the impact and rolled back along the line a short distance. The fire also affected four coaches from the express train and some goods wagons.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=28}}  All four locomotives of the troop train, the local train and the express (which was [[Double-heading|double headed]]) were badly damaged by fire and the intensity of the fire was such that all the coal in the [[Tender (rail)|tenders]] was consumed.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=28}}

==Rescue efforts==
Amongst the first rescuers to arrive at the scene were Mr and Mrs Dunbar, caretakers at The Old Blacksmith's Shop, Gretna Green. Mrs Dunbar stated that when she heard the crash, her immediate thought was that the Germans had come. Mrs Dunbar telephoned doctors in [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]] for assistance. Mr Dunbar spent the day assisting the rescue efforts.<ref name=Times240515a/>

The last known survivor of the accident, Peter Stoddart, was interviewed by [[Michael Simkins]] in 2001. Simkins wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "I asked him about a story I had heard of an officer who went about the scene shooting men trapped in the burning wreckage. 'That was true. I saw that. He was a Scottish gentleman, eventually a millionaire. But he had to.' There was a suspicion of a chuckle in his voice as he added: 'And there were one or two other survivors who made themselves scarce. They took their opportunity.'"<ref name="The Guardian 18 May 2001">{{cite web | title= The express hit us and then I lost consciousness |url= http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/18/transport.uk | last= Simkins | first= Michael | date= 18 May 2001| work= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 23 May 2015}}</ref> 

On 16 May 2015, the BBC reported Colonel Robert Watson, a senior retired army officer who had served with the [[Royal Scots]], saying that he believed that some soldiers were "probably" shot in mercy killings. The BBC said that while no official army records of the alleged shooting existed, "many reports written in the press at the time of the accident suggested that some trapped soldiers, threatened with the prospect of being burnt alive in the raging inferno, took their own lives or were shot by their officers". The Colonel’s remarks were recorded for a BBC Scotland documentary made to mark the centenary of the disaster, ''Quintinshill: Britain's Deadliest Rail Disaster''. He told the documentary makers: "All those that could be rescued were rescued. Many of them had amputations carried out underneath burning carriages so that they could be rescued. But many, of course, were trapped in such a position that they couldn't be got out or else the fire had taken hold and they couldn't be got to. And of course since then we've heard stories of some soldiers being shot and some soldiers possibly taking their own lives. It's never been formally documented. My own personal belief is that it probably did happen, in a sense of compassion, of mercy killing. It's almost impossible, sitting here, to comprehend what it was like that morning." However, the BBC said that this section of the interview with Watson would not be broadcast.<ref name="BBC News 16 May 2015">{{cite web | title= Quintinshill: train disaster mercy killings 'probable'|url=  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32710602| |date= 16 May 2015| website= BBC News | accessdate= 22 May 2015}}</ref>
According to Earnshaw "Many were trapped inside the burning train; injured men with no hope of escape begged their rescuers to shoot them whilst gunfire added an eerie effect to the scene as small arms and rifle shells in the luggage vans began to explode in the intense heat."{{sfn|Earnshaw|1996|p=73}}

==Aftermath==
By 24 May, newspapers were already reporting the accident as the deadliest in the United Kingdom. The initial estimate was 158 dead, with over 200 injured. The bodies of the victims were initially laid in a field by the line and covered in white sheets. They were later taken to a nearby farm or to Gretna Green Village Hall. The [[Board of Trade]] appointed [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] E. Druitt, [[Royal Engineers|R.E.]] to head the inquiry into the Accident. [[George V|The King]] sent a [[telegram]] to Caledonian Railway general manager [[Donald Mathieson (businessman)|Donald Mathieson]] expressing sympathy and asking to be kept informed of the recovery of those injured.<ref name=Times240515a>{{Cite newspaper The Times  |articlename=Troop Train Disaster |day_of_week=Monday |date=24 May 1915 |page_number=7, 8 |issue=40862 |column=F, A }}</ref> On 23 May, a recruitment meeting was held at the [[Usher Hall]], Edinburgh to raise a new battalion.<ref name=Times240515b/> The railway was reopened through Quintinshill on the morning of 25 May, although not all the wreckage had been removed.

==Casualties==
[[File:QuintinshillILN2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The roll call of the survivors of 1/7th Royal Scots after the accident]]
The overwhelming majority of fatalities were among the men of the Royal Scots and the precise number was not established as the roll list of the regiment was destroyed by the fire.  Lt.-Col. Druitt's official report gives an estimated total of 215 deaths and a further 191 injured.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=30}} Of the 500 soldiers of the 7th [[Battalion]] of the [[Royal Scots]] on the troop train, only 58 men were present for [[roll call]] at 4.00 pm that afternoon, along with seven officers.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=60}} In total, 226 people died and 246 were injured. The engine crew of the troop train also died in the first collision.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=45}} Both driver Scott and fireman Hannan had driven the [[Royal Train]].<ref name=Times250515/>

Considering the double collision and the fire, casualties in the other trains were lighter than might have been expected.  On the local train two passengers died, with none seriously injured; on the express seven passengers died, with a further 51 and 3 members of railway staff seriously injured.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=30}}

===Funerals===
[[File:Funeral procession for victims of the Gretna rail disaster, 1915.jpg|thumb|right|The funeral procession passes Pilrig Church on its way to the cemetery.]]
Some of the bodies were never recovered, having been wholly consumed by the fire, and when the bodies of the men of the Royal Scots were returned to Leith on 24 May, they were buried together in a mass grave in [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Rosebank Cemetery]].{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=67}} The coffins were laid three deep, with each on the top row covered in the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|Union Flag]]. The public were excluded from the cemetery, although 50 wounded servicemen who were convalescing at a nearby military hospital were allowed to attend. The ceremony lasted three hours, at the end of which a volley of three shots was fired and the [[Last Post]] was sounded.<ref name=Times250515/>

The bodies were escorted by the 15th and 16th Battalions Royal Scots, the Edinburgh [[Pals battalion]]s recently assembled and still undergoing training. The cortege took four hours to complete its task. A memorial to the dead troops was erected in Rosebank Cemetery in 1916.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=135}}

Of the troops, 83 bodies were identified, 82 were recovered but unrecognisable, and 50 were missing altogether,{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=59}} giving the total of 215, later revised by the army to 214.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=67}} The soldiers were buried with full [[military honours]].<ref name=Times240515b>{{Cite newspaper The Times  |articlename=The Signalman's Story |day_of_week=Monday |date=24 May 1915 |page_number=8 |issue=40862 |column=C }}</ref>

Among the coffins were four bodies which were unidentified, and appeared to be remains of children<!--(but may not have been: see talk page section "The Four Unidentified Children")-->.  One coffin was simply labelled as 'little girl, unrecognisable,' and another as 'three trunks, probably children'.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=67}}  As no children were reported missing the railway company moved the bodies to Glasgow for possible identification, but no one came forward to claim the bodies.  The four were buried in Glasgow's Western [[Necropolis]] on 26 May.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=67}} The engine crew of the troop train were both from Carlisle, and they were also buried on 26 May at Stanwix Cemetery.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|pp=67–68}}

===Survivors===
The surviving officers and men of the Royal Scots were taken to Carlisle on the evening of 22 May. The next morning they went on by train to Liverpool, but on arrival there they were medically examined: all the enlisted men and one officer were declared unfit for service overseas and were returned to Edinburgh.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=60}} It was reported in the ''Edinburgh Weekly'' that on their march from the port to the railway station the survivors were mistaken for prisoners of war and pelted by some children.{{sfn|Hamilton|1969|p=74}}

==Investigations==

===Board of Trade inquiry===
The first official investigation into the disaster commenced in Carlisle on 25 May at County Hall, Carlisle.<ref name=Times260515>{{Cite newspaper The Times  |articlename=Gretna Disaster Inquiry |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=26 May 1915 |page_number=5 |issue=40864 |column=A, B }}</ref> It was conducted by Lieutenant Colonel E. Druitt [[Royal Engineers|RE]] of the [[Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate|Railway Inspectorate]] on behalf of the [[Board of Trade]]. Lt.-Col. Druitt had already spent some time at the accident site and spent the day in Carlisle interviewing witnesses including both Meakin and Tinsley.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|pp=71–72}} Both men were honest about their failures to abide by the rules and their generally lax behaviour.  Lt.-Col. Druitt presented his report to the Board of Trade on 17 June 1915 and laid the blame squarely on Meakin and Tinsley.
<blockquote>This disastrous collision was thus due to want of discipline on the part of the signalmen, first by changing duty at an unauthorised hour, which caused Tinsley to be occupied in writing up the Train Register Book, and so diverted his attention from his proper work, secondly by Meakin handing over the duty in a very lax manner; and, thirdly by both signalmen neglecting to carry out various rules specially framed for preventing accidents due to forgetfulness on the part of signalmen.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=26}}</blockquote>
Druitt was also critical of Fireman Hutchinson for his failure to comply properly with [[rule 55]],{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=25}} and also of Alexander Thorburn, the [[stationmaster]] at [[Gretna (Caledonian) railway station|Gretna]] who had responsibility for Quintinshill signal box and who, in Lt.-Col. Druitt's opinion, cannot have been unaware of the irregular shift changes operated by Meakin and Tinsley.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=26}}

Druitt concluded that even had all the trains been lit by electricity, a fire would still have occurred as the wagons of the goods train in the down loop caught fire.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=27}}  He also concluded that had Quintinshill been equipped with [[track circuit]]ing, then the accident would have been avoided as the electrical [[interlocking]] of the signals would have prevented Tinsley from pulling the relevant signal levers, but that with its simple layout and good visibility from the signal box Quintinshill was a low priority for track circuits to be installed.{{sfn|Druitt|1915|p=26}}

===Coroner's inquest in England===
The legal position was complicated by the fact that although the accident occurred in Scotland, some of the injured subsequently died in England where the law was different.  In Scotland, deaths were investigated by the [[procurator fiscal]] who, if he found culpability on the part of anyone, could order their arrest and charge them with culpable homicide.{{#tag:ref|The charge of [[Manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]] is not known to Scottish law, culpable homicide is the equivalent.{{sfn|Gillon|2006|p=34}}|group=nb}}{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=68–69}}  In England the [[coroner]] investigated death and, if the [[coroner's jury]] found that death was due to neglect, then the coroner could indict charges of manslaughter against the named parties.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=68}}  The coroner for Carlisle, Mr T S Strong, asked for guidance from the [[Home Office]] and was instructed to conduct inquests on those who had died in England in the normal way.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=69}}  The inquest opened on 25 May but was immediately adjourned until 23 June to allow Lt-Col. Druitt to finish his investigation.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=72}}  After two days hearing evidence from, among others, Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson, Strong summed up the evidence to the nineteen-man jury. He highlighted that if Meakin and Tinsley had obeyed the rules on any of (a) blocking back, (b) lever collars or (c) a correctly kept train register, they could not have forgotten the stationary train.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=99}}  He concluded his summing up with:
<blockquote>If you find as a result of your deliberations that the rules and safeguards were broken by one or more of the railwaymen concerned, or in other words that they have been negligent, there remains one point which you must decide, and it is this.<br>
Was that negligence of such a character—having regard to all the surroundings—as to be culpable negligence, or in other words gross negligence?<br>
If so it was manslaughter.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=108}}</blockquote>

The jury retired and an hour later came back with a verdict that the 27 people who were the subject of the inquest had died due to the gross negligence of Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson.  The coroner therefore committed all three to the next sitting of Cumberland [[Assizes]] on a charge of manslaughter; all three were granted [[bail]].{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=109}}

The solicitor representing the three railwaymen protested that the committing of them to trial was outside the Coroner's jurisdiction, as the alleged offence had been committed in Scotland. The Coroner stated that he had been instructed to proceed with the inquest by the Home Office.<ref name=Times250615>{{Cite newspaper The Times  |articlename=Gretna Green Disaster |day_of_week=Friday |date=25 June 1915 |page_number=5 |issue=40890 |column=C }}</ref> The verdict of the English inquest was to leave Tinsley in an unusual position, as he was arrested by the Scottish authorities on 29 May 1915,<ref name=Times310515>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Gretna Train Disaster |day_of_week=Monday |date=31 May 1915 |page_number=3 |issue=40868 |column=B }}</ref> and charged with culpable homicide. He now faced a charge of manslaughter in England based on the same facts. After discussion between the [[Law Officers of the Crown|Law Officers]] of England and Scotland, it was decided to proceed against the three men in Scotland.

The three had become the first men ever to be indicted for the same crime in two UK countries.{{sfn|Earnshaw|1996|p=73}}

===Trial of Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson===
The trial of the three men started on 24 September 1915 in the [[High Court in Edinburgh]]. The  [[Lord Justice General]], [[Alexander Ure, 1st Baron Strathclyde|Lord Strathclyde]], presided over the trial;  the [[Lord Advocate]], [[Robert Munro, 1st Baron Alness|Robert Munro]] [[Queen's Counsel|KC]] prosecuted and the three men were defended by [[James Condie Stewart Sandeman|Condie Sandeman]] KC.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=110}}  Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson all pleaded not guilty to the charges of culpable homicide and breach of duty against them.  The trial lasted a day and a half; after the prosecution had concluded their case, Sandeman submitted to the Lord Justice General that there was no case to answer by Hutchinson.  This submission was accepted by the Lord Justice General and the jury were instructed to find him not guilty at the conclusion of the trial.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=113}}  Sandeman called no witnesses on the part of Meakin and Tinsley but instead sought to persuade the jury that neither had been criminally negligent but that Tinsley had just had a momentary loss of memory.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=116}}

After Sandeman's speech, Lord Strathclyde summed up to the jury, ending:
<blockquote>At 6.43 on the morning of the day in question the men in the signal box at Quintinshill were asked to accept the troop train coming from the north.  They accepted it.  That meant that they gave the signal to the north that the line was clear and that the troop train might safely come on.  At that very moment when the signal was given there was before the very eyes of the men in the signal box a local train which was obstructing the line on which the troop train was to run.  One man in the signal box had actually left the train a few minutes before just at the time when it was being shunted on to the up line.  The other man had a few minutes before directed the local train to leave the down main and go on to the up main.<br>
That is the staggering fact that confronts you.<br>
If you can explain that fact consistently with the two men having faithfully and honestly discharged their duties you should acquit them.  If you cannot explain that staggering fact consistently with the men having faithfully discharged their duties then you must convict them.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|pp=118–119}}</blockquote>

The jury retired to consider their verdicts at 12.40 pm and returned only eight minutes later finding Hutchinson not guilty as directed, but finding Tinsley and Meakin guilty as charged.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=119}}  After hearing mitigation on behalf of the two Lord Strathclyde sentenced Tinsley to three years [[penal servitude]] and Meakin to eighteen months [[imprisonment]].{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=119}}

===Fatal accident inquiry in Scotland===
The final legal inquiry into the disaster was held on 4 November 1915 in [[Dumfries]] and was an inquiry under the [[Fatal Accidents Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1895]] into the deaths of the crew of the troop train.  Presided over by [[Sheriff#Scotland|Sheriff]] Campion it came to the same conclusion as the English inquest and the trial that if Meakin and Tinsley had followed the rules then the accident would not have happened.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=120}}

==After the trial==
Meakin and Tinsley were released from prison on 15 December 1916.<ref name=Times081216>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Gretna signalmen to be released |day_of_week=Friday |date=8 December 1916 |page_number=5 |issue=41345 |column=D }}</ref> After release, Tinsley went straight back to working on the Caledonian railway as a lampman.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=121}} He died in 1967.{{sfn|Thomas|1969|p=121}} Meakin also returned to the railway, as a goods train guard. Some years later he was made redundant from that job and set himself up as a coal merchant, trading from Quintinshill siding, right next to the scene of the crash. In the [[World War II|Second World War]], he worked in the Gretna munitions factory until he retired due to ill health.{{sfn|Routledge|2002|p=75}} He died in 1953.

A 2015 [[BBC television]] programme said that it had found old filed documents that said that Tinsley suffered from [[epilepsy]]; the programme theorized that this may have made Tinsley not perceive some events.<ref>{{cite episode|series=Britain's Deadliest Railway Disaster: Quintinshill |network=BBC |date=20 May 2015}}</ref>

The pair were not the first signalmen to be convicted for their part in causing an accident, nor the last. James Holmes was tried for manslaughter following the [[Thirsk rail crash (1892)|Thirsk rail crash]] of 1892, but was given an [[absolute discharge]].{{sfn|Vaughan|1989|p=17}} Signalman Frost was gaoled for two years for his part in causing the [[Connington South rail crash]] in 1967.{{sfn|Vaughan|1989|p=29}}

On 22 May 2015, a remembrance [[quarter peal]] was rung and new method named 'Quintinshill' by bellringers from Derbyshire. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bb.ringingworld.co.uk/view.php?id=465072 |title=Bell Board |work=Ringing World |date=23 May 2015 |accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref>

== Similar accidents ==
The [[Hawes Junction rail crash]] of 1910 also involved a busy signalman forgetting about a train on the main railway line. Likewise, at the [[Winwick rail crash]] of 1934, an overworked signalman forgot about a train in his section, and was misled by a junior.
